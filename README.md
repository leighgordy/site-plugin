# site-plugin

This is a webpack project that has been designed to be imported as an ES6 module by other projects. 
This pattern allows you to break up a large web application into several projects. 
This is useful when you are reusing components in different projects or if you want several teams 
of developers to work on a very large project. 

This is exported as an ES6 module to allow tree shaking. It also uses [styled components](https://styled-components.com/) project to bundle the CSS into the JS module.
